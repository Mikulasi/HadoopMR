Many developers and data scientists need to critically analyse how this framework can be used for data processing in a
much efficient way. Though Hadoop is known for analysing huge files, for that need to divide those huge and complex data
sets and store them in Hadoopdistributedfile system. In some cases, we might need to use Hadoop to analyse multiple
domainsâ€™ data (for example, when it comes to healthcare within the insurance sector). Healthcare data needs to be analysed
by insurance companies in order to set-up insurance plans for different patients. For this, it is highly recommended to
provide the correct parameters. There is a high chance of one domain being dependent on another similar to e-commerce shopping
sites using sentimental analysis for making decisions for their users that are buying products on their website.
